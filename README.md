# Hadoop-Essentials

This is the code repository for [Hadoop-Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hadoop-essentials?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784396688), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions and Navigation:

All of the code is organized into folders.
Each folder starts with `C` followed by the chapter number.
For example, `HDFS commands.txt` is a file from Chap 1, and `HBase commands.txt` is one from Chap 5.


## What you need for the code files:

A prerequisite of Java programming and basics of distributed computing will be very helpful and an interest to understand about 
Hadoop and its ecosystem components.
The code and syntax have been tested in Hadoop 2.4.1 and other compatible ecosystem component versions, but may vary in the 
newer version.
